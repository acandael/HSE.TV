Video Tutorial Application with Ruby on Rails

This is a Tealeaf Labs Project.

HSE.TV is a video tutorial 

The video tutorial app is composed of the following components:

a course: a course has a subject and a description and consists of a number of modules.
a module: a module is a subtheme within a course. Say you have a course on Rails, then a module could be "Testing in Rails", another module could be "Securing your App", "Deploying your App", etc ... Each module consists of a bunch of lessons.
a video: a short video explaining some key concepts in the lesson
a quiz: a multiple choice quiz, with questions about concepts that where covered in the video
an organization: an organization can take a subscription plan (bronze, silver, gold) for its employees

A popular way of learning nowadays is through gamification. This means that a user gets rewarded when processing through the code.
The way I see it right now, but this is by no means set, is that a user receives a badge for completing a module. He should also be rewarded for ending the course.
Also a nice motivator for completing the course would be by enabling the user to tweet his achievements or post on Facebook.
